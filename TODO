1. Improve graceful shutdown. Currently there is a coroutine that gives an error (cpool cleanup)
2. Fix bug with tunnel src/dst matches in Ryu rest API - low priority
3. Add verbose argument to rgw.py for debugging
4. Add a CES / RGW argument to the code for the operation mode (no SDN controller needed in RGW)
