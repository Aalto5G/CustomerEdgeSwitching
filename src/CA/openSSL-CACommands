Creating the CA root key and certificate

	Complete the following procedure to create a client trusted CA key and certificate.
	Impact of procedure: Performing the following procedure should not have a negative impact on your system.

	    Generate a random number file by using the following command syntax:

	    openssl rand -out <Directory-Path>/<Random-Number-Filename> <Size-to-seed-the-Random-Number>
	    For example, to generate a random number with the /shared/exampleCA/.rand file using the 2048 byte size, type the following command:
	    openssl rand -out /shared/exampleCA/.rand 2048

	    Generate a CA key by using the following command syntax:
	    openssl genrsa -rand <Directory-Path>/<Random-Number-Filename> -out <Directory-Path>/<CA-Key-Filename> <Key-Strength: Number-of-bits>
	    For example, to create the clientCA.key CA key using the random /shared/exampleCA/.rand number file and the key size of 2048 bits, type the following command:
	    openssl genrsa -rand /shared/exampleCA/.rand -out /shared/exampleCA/clientCA.key 2048

	    Generate a CA certificate by using the following command syntax:
	    openssl req -x509 -new -key <Directory-Path>/<CA-Key-Filename> -out <Directory-Path>/<CA-Cert-Filename> -days <Number-of-Days>
	    For example, to generate a clientCA.crt CA certificate of type x509, using the clientCA.key key that is valid for 7300 days, type the following command:
	    openssl req -x509 -new -key /shared/exampleCA/clientCA.key -out /shared/exampleCA/clientCA.crt -days 7300

Creating and signing a client certificate

	Complete the following procedure to create and sign a certificate using the trusted CA.
	Impact of procedure: Performing the following procedure should not have a negative impact on your system.

	    Create a client certificate key by using the following command syntax:
	    openssl genrsa -rand <Directory-Path>/<Random-Number-Filename> -out <Directory-Path>/<Client-Certificate-Key-Filename> <Key-Strength-in-Bits>
	    For example, to create a client1.key client certificate key using the random /shared/exampleCA/.rand number file and the key size of 2048 bits, type following:
	    openssl genrsa -rand ca.rand -out client1.key 2048

	    Create a client certificate signing request (CSR) by using the following command syntax:
	    openssl req -new -out <Directory-Path>/<Client-CSR-Filename> -key <Directory-Path>/<Client-Certificate-Key-Filename>
	    For example, to create a client1.req client CSR using the client1.key client certificate key, type the following command:
	    openssl req -new -out client1.req -key client1.key

	    Create and sign the client certificate by using the following command syntax:
	    openssl x509 -req -in <Directory-Path>/<Client-Certificate-Request-Filename> -out <Directory-Path>/<Client-Certificate-Filename> -CAkey <Directory-Path>/<CA-Key-Filename> -CA <Directory-Path>/<CA-Cert-Filename> -days <Number-of-Days> -CAcreateserial -CAserial serial
	    For example, to create the client1.crt client certificate that is valid for 365 days using the client1.req client certificate request, and sign it with the clientCA.key CA key and clientCA.crt CA cert, type the following command:
	    openssl x509 -req -in client1.req -out client1.crt -CAkey CA.key -CA CA.crt -days 365 -CAcreateserial -CAserial serial
