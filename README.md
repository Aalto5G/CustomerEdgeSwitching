## Useful information

### Create python virtual environment

If you don't want to populute your system with extra libraries and modules, you can can create a python virtual environment using the following guide:

http://askubuntu.com/questions/244641/how-to-set-up-and-use-a-virtual-python-environment-in-ubuntu

Remember that the virtual environment shortcuts are not available when doing ```sudo``` per se, but you can achieve admin rights for your python interpreter with the following:

```
$ sudo /root/to/.virtualenvs/your_virtual_environment/bin/python
```

### Linux bridged & iptables

It is very common to deploy Linux bridges to trigger iptables packet processing to that traffic.
However, additional kernel modules need to be loaded.

```
# modprobe br_netfilter
# modprobe xt_physdev
```

In order to send traffic from the linux bridge to iptables modify your ```/etc/sysctl.conf``` to include the following:

```
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-filter-pppoe-tagged=0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-filter-vlan-tagged=1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-pass-vlan-input-dev=1
```
